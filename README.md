# smart_home_c_code
This project is an IoT-based system that enables real-time control and monitoring of multiple devices (LEDs, motors, relays) using FreeRTOS, UART communication, and EEPROM logging for embedded operations. The project is integrated with a Flutter mobile application, allowing remote control and monitoring over Bluetooth.
